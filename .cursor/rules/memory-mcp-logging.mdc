# Memory MCP Logging

**MANDATORY: Log all failures and successes to Memory MCP**

## Log Failures

When something doesn't work, log to memory MCP:
- What was attempted
- Why it failed
- What the error was
- What was tested

## Log Successes

When something works, log to memory MCP:
- What worked
- Under what conditions
- What tests verified it

## Before Implementing

Check memory MCP for previous attempts and results to avoid repeating failed approaches.
