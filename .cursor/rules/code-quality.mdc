# Code Quality

## Testing
- Write tests that fail first, then fix the code
- Test edge cases: zeros, Inf, NaN, extreme values
- Verify fixes work with real data, not just test data

## Documentation
- **DO NOT create .md files unless explicitly requested by user**
- Focus on fixing code, not documenting
- Only create documentation when user explicitly asks

## Focus
- Focus on fixing, not documenting
- Test everything analytically
- When you think something "should" work, write a test instead
