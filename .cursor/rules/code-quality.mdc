# Code Quality

## Testing
- Write tests that fail first, then fix the code
- Test edge cases: zeros, Inf, NaN, extreme values
- Verify fixes work with real data, not just test data

## Documentation
- **DO NOT create .md files unless explicitly requested by user**
- Focus on fixing code, not documenting
- Only create documentation when user explicitly asks

## Focus
- Focus on fixing, not documenting
- Test everything analytically
- When you think something "should" work, write a test instead

## "Should" Claims - CRITICAL RULE
- **NEVER say "should" without verifying it yourself first**
- Every time you say "should", it means you MUST test/verify it immediately
- If you can't test it right now, don't say "should" - say "needs to be tested" or "will need verification"
- The word "should" is a commitment to have verified something yourself
- User has spent 24+ hours debugging after multiple "should work" claims that didn't work
- Pattern: Test first, then claim - never claim then test
